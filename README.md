## Installing as temporary extension

To install the extension as a temporary extension in Firefox:

1. Open Firefox and load the `about:debugging` page. Click [Load Temporary Add-on](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) and select the `manifest.json` file within the folder of an example extension. Here is a [video](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=cer9EUKegG4) that demonstrates how to do this. 

Note that extensions do not work in private browsing windows by default, see [Extensions in Private Browsing](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/extensions-private-browsing#w_enabling-or-disabling-extensions-in-private-windows) for details.
